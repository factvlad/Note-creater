  In this project I mastered:
 - React
 - react-create-app 
 - redux, redux-thunk, react-redux 
 - react-router
 - styled-components
 - react-infinite-scroll-component 
 
 
 All components are in the `src` folder. All another files was generated by `react-create-app`
 
 You can run this project locally just do:
 - clone branch `master` with `git clone https://github.com/factvlad/note-creater.git` or fork it and then clone it from your forked repo
 - `cd note-creater`
 - `npm install` 
 - `npm start`
